        <p>This site has been created to help Mom’s know how to plan their days. If the website directs them that the weather is going to be cold, they can know how to dress their kids for school or and outing. The website can also aide Mom’s in knowing what activities to plan for different days based on the weather. For instance, if they want to go swimming outside with their kids, they can see which day will be best to go based on the weather information they receive. Or if it is going to be cold, then they can search for indoor activities instead. There are so many factors involved in being prepared for an outing with kids, that this website can help Mom’s as they plan and make decisions.</p>
