            <h2>Target Audience</h2>
            <p>My target audience is focused on stay at home Mom’s who love to participate in activities with their kids and have the financial means to spend money on various family memberships to attractions such as the zoo, museums, and aquariums. These Mom’s like to be prepared and need to know how to dress their kids, what items to pack, and where they should plan to go. They like to provide experiences for their kids whether they are taking them to the park, the library, or a museum and each experience calls for different preparation. They are primarily between the ages of 25-35 and have young children between the ages of newborn and 12 years old. Most of the target audience will be used to making decisions based on the weather, but it is an important part of their planning process. </p>
